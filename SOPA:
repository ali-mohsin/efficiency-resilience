SOPA:


key contributions:
	- Increased FR threshold to decrease num of unneccessary retx
	- Balance the load in round robin so that exact load balancing is done


issues:
	- what is the number of collisions in ecmp, motivation why is that an issue at all?
	- overhead of round robin?
	- deployability is a concern
	-  FR ka maksad mar gya
	- will the solution still have same gains in real DC
	- fig 3 shows nothing about inefficiencies of rps
